Project includes 9 SQL Server queries, which can be copy-pasted to SSMS Keyboard shortcuts and used by simple keystrokes against SQL Servers.
Fully supported for SQL Server versions 2012 and up. 
Some keystroke queries work on SQL Servers 2008 & 2008R2.

Essential SQL Server permissions to run scripts:
- CONNECT SQL
- VIEW ANY DATABASE
- VIEW ANY DEFINITION
- VIEW SERVER STATE

Desired SQL Server permissions to run scripts for problem troubleshooting:
- EXECUTE xp_readerrorlog

Disclosures:
1. Scripts might not work well against Express editions.
2. Maximum query size is 32768 bytes.
3. Queries can not contain carriage return symbol (0x0D). The only option is to use end of a line symbol (0x0A).
4. Scripts don not do ANY changes in ANY database except temporary objects in "tempdb" database. List of objects is in separate document.
5. Scripts are not tested in all possible environments and under all possible circumstances and provided AS IS. In case of any run-time error, output scripts can be easily modified to avoid blocking, configuration of security constrains.

Installation process:
- Start SSMS
- Open "Tools" from the Menu (Alt+T)
- Choose "Options" from "Tools" (+O)
