
1. Key assignments are "Historical" and you can rearrange it for your own preferences.
2. Proposed solution DOES NOT WORK in all possible environments. It is mostly oriented on Enterprise Edition of currently most common version of SQL Server 2016.
   If a particular scripts does not work in your environment – change it to fit! (or ask me for help)
3. When object names are not unique in a database, the result set will be returned only for the first instance. (Applicable for Statistics)
4. I tried not to use Try-Catch blocks to save the space. If Microsoft will extend keyboard query size then it would be possible to add more comprehensive logic.

Known issues:
Ctrl-F1 - When you run for a table it gives you an "sp_estimate_data_compression_savings" stored procedure error for non-enterprise edition of earlier versions than SQL Server 2016. 


Big thanks for all known and unknown contributors of queries I've used in that solution.
